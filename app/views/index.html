                The Royal Drawing School was founded in 2000 by King Charles III (then HRH The Prince of Wales) and artist Catherine Goodman to raise the standard and profile of observational drawing.
                Established as a not-for-profit, artist-led institution, the school set out to offer world-class tuition to students regardless of background or previous experience.
                What began as a single postgraduate programme has since grown into a vibrant creative community offering over 350 courses annually to the public, young artists, and professionals.
                Our flagship postgraduate course, The Drawing Year, is fully funded and has become one of the most sought-after places for emerging artists.
                The School's Shoreditch campus and satellite locations are now internationally recognised for nurturing both technical skill and artistic innovation.
