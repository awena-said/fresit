The course was really well structured yet there was no pressure. Presentations of Artists\' work were varied and stimulating leaving the student with lots of ideas. Practical help was always on hand and over the 10 weeks it became an open and friendly working experience - yet the outcomes and achievements were exceptionally high. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who practices.'

However I cannot agree with RDS\'s policy to limit to just one solvent brand we all must use. I do understand the reason why they want us to use non-toxic solvent but nowadays there are more than one such solvents exist. And their choice is the least commonly available one. I must say Â£7.5 for 200ml of this particular solvent was good buy, however, the problem was 200ml wasn\'t enough for most of us. We couldn\'t purchase more than 200ml. At least we should have freedom to purchase additional amount if RDS want to stick with this brand. I hope RDS will reconsider this policy by Summer, then we will be able to clean our brushes more frequently.'
